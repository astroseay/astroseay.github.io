...at Leiden University (LU) and Delft University (DU) as an interdisciplinary PhD candidate with Matthew Kenworthy (LU) and Dominic Dirkx (DU). Specifically, I focus on the detectability of Tidally Heated ExoMoons (THEMs), modeling their detectability and interiors. In the past, I've worked on several projects: at UC Santa Cruz I worked with Jonathan Fortney on modeling brown dwarf and hot Jupiter atmospheres. We are interested in the thermal evolution of these astrophysical objects in addition to their compositions in order to characterize them. As my first year project at Leiden I worked with Yamila Miguel modeling the interiors of hot Jupiters with MESA and simulating oscillatory modes with GYRE to investigate what might excite hot Jupiter oscillations. My master's thesis was with Matt searching for co-moving companions around Sun-like stars in the nearest OB-associating Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen).

Finding co-moving companions around Sun-like stars
======
One major area of exoplanet detection and characterization involves gathering a large sample size of planets orbiting stars like our own. Taking HCI VLT/SPHERE data originally from Bohn, A. et al. I queried the ESO archives for additional epochs for 11 of 72 stars in their [YSES survey](shorturl.at/ILPS7). We computed accurate and precise astrometry to analyze companion candidate proper motions in order to determine the nature of these objects in the primary target field-of-view. I confirmed the primary target 2MASSJ12560830-6926539 (roughly 130 pc) is a trinary star system, with the primary target consisting of two stars: one close-in (hereafter 2M1256Ab) at 29 au separation and a farther object (2M1256B) orbiting 100 pc away (500 au separation) respectively. Using orbital models obtained with [orbitize!](http://orbitize.info/en/latest/), we calculated a median orbital period of 292 years assuming a circular orbit and 342 years not assuming a circular orbit. We'd like to better constrain the shape of the orbit, but for that we'll need more data! We also constrained the mass of 2M1256B to 82 / 49 Jupiter masses using photometric data from 2MASS and GAIA and fitting the results to a 3 Myr BT Settl isochrone using the model effective temperature and luminosity respectively (T<sub>eff</sub> / L).

A big thank-you to academic pages template makers and all others who've made this website easier to make!

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
